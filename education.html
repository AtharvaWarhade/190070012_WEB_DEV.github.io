                <h1>My Education</h1>

                <p>
                    Currently I am studying at the <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/" id="links" target="_blank">Indian 
                    Institute of Technology, Bombay</a> ,but looking back, I've come a long way.

                    I was born and raised in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; hence, my schooling years were spent in Nagpur. From
                    pre-primary to the final years of my secondary education, I was schooled in <a href="http://sandipanischool.edu.in/" id="links" target="_blank">
                    S<span style = "text-decoration: overline">A</span>NDIPANI SCHOOL</a>. I had never ever changed schools if not for the branch change from Class 4
                    to Class 5, where I shifted from S<span style = "text-decoration: overline">A</span>NDIPANI Civil Lines to 
                    S<span style = "text-decoration: overline">A</span>NDIPANI HazariPahad.                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After my secondary schooling, I joined the Yashoda College for my junior college studies. As I was preparing for JEE
                    (Main + Advanced), I had to opt for the Science field and I choose my optional BiFocal Subject as Computer Science. 
                    I rarely went to college though. During the same time, I had also joined the <a href="http://www.icadiit.com/" id="links" target="_blank">ICAD institute</a>; it 
                    was a coaching class that helped me prepare for my JEE entrance exams.

                <p>
                    After I cleared my entrances, I admitted to the <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/" id="links" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>, where I 
                    am still currently studying. I am a B Tech first year student in the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/" id="links" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> department
                    as my major.
