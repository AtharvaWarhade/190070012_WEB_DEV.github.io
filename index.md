            <h3>Hey!</h3>
            <p>
                I am Atharva Warhade. I am pursueing my major in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> while studying at the <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</b>;.<br>
                I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year <b>B Tech</b> student enrolled in the year 2019. If you wnat to find me in the institute, you can try visiting <b>H16 A</b>, room <b>315</b> 
                (trust me, that's the only definite place you can find me at).
            </p>

        </center>
        <p>
            I don't have hobbies that I actually try to pursue, but there do exist things that I find interesting. Some of them might include:
            <ul>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Running</li>
                <li>Cycling</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Meditation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </div>
        <hr style="width: 60%;">

        <!--My ambitions-->
        <div id="ambitions" style="text-align: left; font-size: larger;">

            <h2>My Ambitions</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            My dream is to become a <b>Paleontologist</b>. Now, I know what you might be thinking; that <i>Paleontology</i> is <b>not</b> an engineering field. But trust me, I have it all figured out!
            (or so he says!). Becoming a Paleontologist was my dream since I was 7, and I just can't give up on it even today.<br>
            
            That's still far fetched though. Right now, I would like to complete my college education and then maybe get a <b>Master's degree</b> from somewhere outside. Then I would like to work full time
            at a job to earn some income, and when I think I had earned enough, I'll quit it to pursue Paleontology (See, all planned out!).
